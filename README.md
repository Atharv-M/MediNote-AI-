# MediNote AI: Intelligent Medical Note Processing and Assistance

# üìù Executive Summary

**MediNote AI** is an advanced, AI-powered system designed to streamline and enhance the process of handling clinical documentation. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques, the platform transforms unstructured doctor's notes into actionable, structured data, significantly improving efficiency, reducing documentation burden, and ensuring data integrity in healthcare settings.

The core function is to intelligently process medical transcripts and notes (`doctor_notes.csv`) to provide valuable insights and automation capabilities for healthcare professionals.

## ‚ú® Key Features

  * **Intelligent Note Parsing:** Automatically processes raw, unstructured doctor's notes (`.csv`, text files, etc.) to extract key clinical entities, diagnoses, and treatment plans.
  * **Medical Terminology Standardization:** Utilizes industry-standard ontologies and mappings (e.g., ICD-10, SNOMED) to standardize extracted medical terms for consistent data reporting.
  * **Clinical Summarization:** Generates concise, professional summaries of lengthy patient encounters, suitable for Electronic Health Record (EHR) integration.
  * **Data-Driven Insights:** Provides the foundation for predictive analytics, quality assurance audits, and research by transforming narrative data into a structured format.
  * **Web Application Interface:** Includes a user-friendly application interface (`app.py`) for easy interaction, demonstration, and deployment of the AI models.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

| Category | Technology | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Backend/Core** | Python | Primary programming language. |
| **Machine Learning** | (Inferred Libraries) `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `pickle` | Model training, data handling, and persistence (`pklfiles`). |
| **Web Framework** | (Inferred) `Streamlit` or `Flask` (Based on `app.py` convention) | Hosting the interactive application. |
| **Data Storage** | CSV (`doctor_notes.csv`) | Dataset for training or initial demonstration. |
| **Environment** | `requirements.txt` | Dependency management. |

## üöÄ Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through setting up and running the project locally for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You must have Python 3.8+ installed on your system.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Atharv-M/MediNote-AI-.git
    cd MediNote-AI-
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    # .\venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    The project relies on libraries listed in `requirements.txt`.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

1.  **Run the Main Application:**
    Execute the primary application file. If `app.py` is a Streamlit application, use the following command:

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

    *If it is a Flask/other application, the command will vary (e.g., `python app.py`). Please adjust based on the framework used.*

2.  **Access the Interface:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to the local address displayed in your terminal (usually `http://localhost:8501` for Streamlit).

## üìÇ Project Structure

| File/Folder | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `app.py` | Main application file for running the web interface/demo. |
| `doctor_notes.csv` | Sample dataset containing clinical text used for model training or demonstration. |
| `requirements.txt` | List of all Python dependencies required to run the project. |
| `pklfiles/` | Directory for storing serialized machine learning models (e.g., trained pipelines, vectorizers). |
| `tools/` | Utility scripts or auxiliary functionalities. |
| `utils/` | Common helper functions and modules. |
